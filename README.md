# Augmented-reality-pipe-finder
 The basic principle is to scan the building, during construction time, at the time where facilities are installed but not yet covered with plaster, drywall or flooring. The scan is done with a 3D camera. The color component of the scan shows the location of all the facilities, while the depth data allows the generation of 3D model of each room.     At any time later, when the house is completed and there is a need to locate facilities in the walls or floor, the room is re-scanned and a new 3D model is generated.  The construction-time 3D model is aligned with a current-time room 3D model. The image of the pipes and wiring is then superimposed on the current image of the walls, providing an augmented reality picture of the walls, showing clearly where exactly the facilities are.  This can be done in real time (as you scan the walls) or offline, where the scan from the construction time, and the current-time scan are merged.
